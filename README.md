# myBot
The purpose of this bot is to use Twitter APIS to tweet the most updated pins from pinterest link. This would serve as a substitue instead of using Pinterest APIs becuase they are currently in the process of updating their program.

The bot can be ran using pythonw.exe scheduledTwitterBot.py, this ensures that the bot is automated and runs in the background without the terminal being open.
